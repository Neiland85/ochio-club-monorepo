## Fix build and basic authentication structure â€¦ (4f5e870)

Fix build and enhance authentication structure

Updates dependencies, adds validation middleware, and refines authentication and user management routes/services to improve security and functionality.

### Changes
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated development and runtime dependencies (e.g., `eslint`, `prettier`, `supertest`) and added `express-validator` for request validation.
- **Route Refinements**: Changed route prefixes (`/auth` to `/api/auth`, `/users` to `/api/users`) for consistency.
- **Middleware Enhancements**: Added validation middleware for login and user creation routes using `express-validator`.
- **Service Updates**: Enhanced `UserService` to check for duplicate users and exclude password hashes in user listings.
- **Controller Changes**: Refactored user-related handlers (`getAllUsers`, `createUser`) to use the updated service logic and validation.

### Impact
- **Behavioral Changes**: Improved error handling and request validation in authentication and user management routes.
- **Dependencies Affected**: Integration of `express-validator` and compatibility adjustments for updated dependencies.
- **Breaking Changes**: Route prefixes changed; potential impact on API consumers.
- **Performance Implications**: Minimal; memory-based user storage remains unchanged, but added validations may slightly increase processing time.
