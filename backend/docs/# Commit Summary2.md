## Fix build and basic authentication structure … (4f5e870)

Enhance authentication and improve build stability
This update introduces express-validator for input validation, refines authentication routes, and adjusts user service logic for better security. It also includes dependency updates and minor structural improvements to the backend.

### Changes
- Added **express-validator** for input validation in `authRoutes.ts` and `userRoutes.ts`.
- Updated authentication route prefixes (`/auth` → `/api/auth`) and user routes (`/users` → `/api/users`).
- Refactored user service logic to prevent password hash exposure and avoid duplicate user creation.
- Introduced basic API health check endpoint in `app.ts`.
- Updated dependencies in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, including ESLint, Prettier, and testing libraries (e.g., Supertest).

### Impact
- Behavioral changes include stricter input validation for login and user creation, improving security and reliability.
- Dependencies like **eslint**, **prettier**, and **supertest** were updated, potentially affecting linting and testing workflows.
- Breaking changes in route prefixes may require updates in client-side code or API integration tests.
- Reduced risk of exposing sensitive data (e.g., password hashes) and improved error handling.
