## Agregar disparador workflow_dispatch al workflow (f7cc985)

Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger and audit step to CI workflow

Introduced a manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) and added a dependency audit step to enhance the CI pipeline's flexibility and security.

### Changes
- Added `workflow_dispatch` to the `on` section of `.github/workflows/build-and-serve.yml`, enabling manual triggering of the workflow.
- Introduced a new step named "Audit dependencies" in the `build-and-serve` job to run `npm audit --production`.

### Impact

- **Behavioral changes**: The workflow can now be manually triggered, and a security audit of production dependencies is performed during the build process.
- **Dependencies affected**: Relies on `npm` for auditing, which assumes `npm` is properly configured and available.
- **Breaking changes**: None identified.
- **Performance implications**: Minimal impact; adds a small overhead from running `npm audit`.
